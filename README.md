The hotel reservation analysis project entails leveraging SQL to extract insights from a comprehensive dataset encompassing various attributes such as booking details, guest demographics, room types, market segments, and pricing information. By conducting in-depth analysis, the project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions to enhance guest satisfaction, optimize revenue streams, and streamline operational processes. Through careful examination of booking patterns, market segmentation, and guest preferences, the project endeavors to provide actionable recommendations for pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation, ultimately ensuring the hotel remains competitive, responsive, and attuned to evolving industry dynamics.Additionally, a PowerPoint presentation has been created to visually represent the insights derived from the analysis, facilitating clear communication and understanding of the findings among stakeholders.
